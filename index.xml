      <description>Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. It has a wide range of application scenarios in industry and plays an increasingly important role.
Three types of topics suitable for this sub forum are as follows:</description>

      <guid>/tracks/api.html</guid>
      <description>API is the base of service connectivity. Through API, we can build various services and provide them to users. With the increasing complexity of applications, monolith is gradually split into microservices, and products can be iterated quickly at the same time, it also brings technical challenges in terms of safety, maintenance and observability.
There are many projects in ASF that are related to APIs and gateway, such as Apache APISIX , Apache Shenyu etc.</description>
